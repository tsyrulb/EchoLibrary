# EchoServer
***
## Instructions:
* After cloning repos on your computer, check that you install packages of _Entity Framework Core, Entity Framework Tools, JwtBearer_
* We used Sql DB for Feedback APP and Static DB for API. 
So, in ContextData.cs in 'Repository' folder you can find static DB that we created with some users that already exist. So, if you make changes of url of server, make sure you changed url in ContextData.cs of users. (now it's localhost:7099)
* You need to run simultaneously 'EchoAPI' and 'WebAplication3' (it's app of feedbacks) to use react app (more you will find in README of Echo React repos)

Enjoy Echo Messenger and don't forget to give us your feedback :nerd_face:
